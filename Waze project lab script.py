Conclusion**\n# \n# Recall that your supervisor, May Santer, asked you to share your findings with the data team in an executive summary. Consider the following questions as you prepare to write your summary. Think about key points you may want to share with the team, and what information is most relevant to the user churn project.\n# \n# **Questions:**\n# \n# 1. Did the data contain any missing values? How many, and which variables were affected? Was there a pattern to the missing data?\n# 2. What is a benefit of using the median value of a sample instead of the mean?\n# 3. Did your investigation give rise to further questions that you would like to explore or ask the Waze team about?\n# 4. What percentage of the users in the dataset were Android users and what percentage were iPhone users?\n# 5. What were some distinguishing characteristics of users who churned vs. users who were retained?\n# 6. Was there an appreciable difference in churn rate between iPhone users vs. Android users?\n# \n\n# %% [markdown] {\"id\":\"iMHlK7k5_2PV\"}\n# ==> ENTER YOUR RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS 1-6 HERE\n# \n# **Questions:**\n# \n# 1. Did the data contain any missing values? How many, and which variables were affected? Was there a pattern to the missing data?\n# Yes it did. there were 700 missing values in the label column. There was no noticeable patterns\n# \n# 2. What is a benefit of using the median value of a sample instead of the mean?\n# The benefit is in order not to have a skewed view as some drives were extremely high values (can take as outliersin this case). the mean will misrepresent the data\n# \n# 3. Did your investigation give rise to further questions that you would like to explore or ask the Waze team about?\n# Yes, The type of vehicles the divers with those high values drives drove. Are they normalcommuters or long haul drives and were just one off.\n# For example, the median user who churned drove 698 kilometers each day they drove last month, which is about 240% the per-drive-day distance of retained users. It would be helpful to know how this data was collected and if it represents a non-random sample of users.\n# \n# 4. What percentage of the users in the dataset were Android users and what percentage were iPhone users?\n# 64% used iPhone and 36% used androids\n# \n# 5. What were some distinguishing characteristics of users who churned vs. users who were retained?\n# Generally, users who churned drove farther and longer in fewer days than retained users. They also used the app about half as many times as retained users over the same period.\n# \n# 6. Was there an appreciable difference in churn rate between iPhone users vs. Android users?\n# \n# No. The churn rate for both iPhone and Android users was within one percentage point of each other. There is nothing suggestive of churn being correlated with device.\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# **Congratulations!** You've completed this lab.","metadata":{"_uuid":"02fad7b3-1974-4c97-a29c-5af906e9f024","_cell_guid":"b137b861-ab0a-47a9-9c4a-3ac94450fc6f","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
